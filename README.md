# PHP-Stack

Program in PHP with RapidWeaver Stacks? Us this stack to fix a few of the PHP problems prevalent throughout Stacks and Stacks plugins. Encase other stacks or display information coming from your database, cloud, server, etc.

Add this to your Stack page instead of using the default HTML element. The default HTML stack wraps your stack in a DIV that occasionally causes problems while using PHP, even makes RapidWeaver crash sometimes.
